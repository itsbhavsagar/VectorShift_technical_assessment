# VectorShift Frontend Technical Assessment

## Introduction

Thank you for participating in the VectorShift frontend technical assessment! This README provides instructions for completing the assessment, which involves working with both frontend and backend components. Youâ€™ll be using JavaScript/React for the frontend and Python/FastAPI for the backend.

## Project Structure

- **Frontend**: Located in the `/frontend` directory.
  - Source files: `/frontend/src`
- **Backend**: Located in the `/backend` directory.
  - Source files: `/backend`

## Setup Instructions

### Frontend

1. Navigate to the `/frontend` directory:
   ```bash
   cd /frontend
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Start the frontend server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

### Backend

1. Navigate to the `/backend` directory:
   ```bash
   cd /backend
   ```
2. Start the backend server:
   ```bash
   uvicorn main:app --reload
   ```

## Assessment Parts

### Part 1: Node Abstraction

- **Objective**: Create an abstraction for node types (inputs, outputs, LLMs, text) to simplify creation and styling of new nodes.
- **Instructions**:
  - In `/frontend/src/nodes`, you will find JavaScript files for different node types.
  - Implement a new abstraction to manage these nodes efficiently.
  - Create five new nodes to demonstrate the effectiveness of your abstraction.

### Part 2: Styling

- **Objective**: Apply styling to the frontend components to create an appealing and unified design.
- **Instructions**:
  - Style various components as per your design vision.
  - You may use existing styles from VectorShift or create your own from scratch.
  - Feel free to use any React packages or libraries for styling.

### Part 3: Text Node Logic

- **Objective**: Enhance the functionality of the Text node to improve text input handling and variable definition.
- **Instructions**:
  - Modify the Text node in `/frontend/src/nodes` to adjust its size dynamically based on text input.
  - Implement variable definition within the text input using double curly brackets (e.g., `{{ input }}`), creating a corresponding Handle.

### Part 4: Backend Integration

- **Objective**: Integrate the frontend with the Python/FastAPI backend.
- **Instructions**:
  - Update `/frontend/src/submit.js` to send node and edge data to the `/pipelines/parse` endpoint.
  - Modify the `/pipelines/parse` endpoint in `/backend/main.py` to calculate the number of nodes and edges and determine if the pipeline forms a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG).
  - Ensure the frontend displays an alert with the results from the backend (number of nodes, edges, and DAG status).
